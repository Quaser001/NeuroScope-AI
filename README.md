## Project Overview
NeuroScope AI addresses the critical gaps in Indian neuro-oncology by fusing multi-modal 3D vision AI with an agentic medical board. It automates tumor segmentation, adheres to global clinical protocols (NCCN/Stupp), and solves "last mile" access issues by integrating Ayushman Bharat insurance codes and localized metabolic diet plans.

## Technology Stack
* **Google Gemini 1.5 Flash** (Agentic Reasoning & Orchestration)
* **MONAI Swin-UNETR** (3D Segmentation Vision Engine)
* **Hugging Face Spaces** (Hosting & Compute)
* **Streamlit** (Frontend UI)
